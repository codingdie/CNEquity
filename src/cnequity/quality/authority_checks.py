"""Compare curated against the bodies that actually publish the numbers.

The other checks in this package all reason about the lake's internal
consistency: does a value look stale, did it change, do two feeds we already
hold agree. None of them can see the failure where a vendor publishes on time,
in the right shape, with a wrong number — which is precisely the failure
issue #3 turned up (``m2_yoy`` carried M0 month-over-month growth for its whole
history, on schedule, in the right column type).

Catching that needs an outside reading, so these three reach the publisher:

* ``macro_pmi_vs_nbs`` — 制造业 PMI against the NBS release
* ``st_labels_vs_exchange`` — ST designations against the SSE / SZSE listings
* ``daily_bars_vs_exchange`` — curated OHLC and turnover against the closes the
  SSE and SZSE publish themselves. Everything else that arbitrates prices does
  it by comparing two vendors against each other, which cannot distinguish
  "both right" from "both wrong the same way".

Both cost network requests, so both are gated on their ``[sources.*]`` flag —
defaulting **off** when the section is absent — and degrade to silence when the
source is unreachable, following ``daily_bars_close_crosscheck_findings``.

**Why M2 is not here.** The PBOC publishes 货币供应量 as levels only, and revised
the M1 caliber from 2025-01. Deriving a year-on-year figure from levels across a
caliber change would manufacture a number the publisher deliberately computes on
a comparable basis, so a derived comparison would report drift that is an
artefact of our own arithmetic. EastMoney's M2 was verified against the PBOC
release by hand (2026-06: 同比 8%, 余额 356.71万亿, and M1/M0 likewise); a
resident check waits for the PBOC to publish the rate itself.
