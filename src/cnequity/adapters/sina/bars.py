"""Sina daily K-line — the delisted-symbol bar source, and a cross-check on TDX.

Two jobs neither primary source can do:

**Delisted history.** TDX serves nothing for a code that has left the market
(verified: empty for 600001/600002/600003/600005, full history for live names),
and EastMoney's kline host is unreachable from many networks. Sina keeps the
whole series, listing day to delisting day, which is what makes a
survivorship-free universe possible at all.

**An independent second opinion on the close.** Sina is a different vendor on a
different protocol from TDX, so comparing closes catches a class of defect no
single-source check can see — most importantly a capture that fires before the
session ends and writes a bar with the right open, a wrong close, and partial
volume.

Two units traps, both verified against a 760-day overlap on 600519.SH:

* ``volume`` is in **shares** (股) — which is what the lake stores, so it
  passes through unchanged. This adapter used to divide by 100 on the belief
  that the lake stored 手; it did not, and that conversion is what put Sina's
  498,985 rows in the wrong unit. See :mod:`cnequity.domain.units`.
* there is **no turnover/amount field**, so ``amount`` is null. Liquidity
  factors built on turnover will not see delisted names. It also means
  ``daily_bars_volume_unit`` cannot check this source from the data — Sina is
  the one path the ratio test is blind to.

Prices are unadjusted, matching the lake's raw-price contract: over that same
760-day overlap 759 days matched the curated close exactly, and the one that did
not was the truncated capture this adapter now helps detect.
